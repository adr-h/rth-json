# Remembering The ... Heisig method JSONs

## What
- Repo to store some JSON lists of Heisig keywords, right now only for Simplified Hanzi
- Also has a dead simple script that sets a `getHeisigSimplifiedHanzi` function on the `window`

## Why
- Needed a quick way to lookup Heisig keywords for my own personal Anki deck

## What next?
- Might add a list for Kanzi + Trad Hanzi eventually. Probably not anytime soon.

## Acknowledgement
- Original JSON was sourced from https://github.com/jcklie/hanzi-website and transformed using `scripts/convert.ts` to strip fields that I didn't need
